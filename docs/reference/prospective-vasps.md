Virtual asset service providers that will be able to operate on the Libra Payment Network at launch

 

## Background

 

At launch and in its first phase, the Libra Payment Network ("LPN") will only be accessible to registered or licensed virtual asset service providers ("VASPs") that meet certain requirements, undergo a risk-based due diligence review, and receive approval from Libra Networks to operate on LPN. Regulated VASPs can take the multiple forms within the Libra ecosystem ranging from exchanges, wallets, merchant or underlying platform services. Each of these Regulated VASPs will have their integration with the Libra Blockchain in common.



Following receipt of authorization to operate on LPN these "**Regulated VASPs**" will be permitted to create Regulated VASP addresses on LPN and will generally not be subject to transaction or address balance limits. 

 

Each entity that qualifies as a Regulated VASP will be required to recertify its Regulated VASP status on an annual basis, and Libra Networks (or an authorized third-party service provider) will also perform ongoing monitoring for any changes in the regulatory status of a Regulated VASP or other developments associated with the Regulated VASP's risk profile. Libra Networks will also record and publish a directory of Regulated VASPs and their status on LPN.

 

For additional details about the LPN and the other categories of participants on the network, please see the Libra White Paper.

 


## Who Qualifies as a Regulated VASP?

 

For purposes of LPN, a "**Regulated VASP**" is a VASP that is (i) registered or licensed in a Financial Action Task Force ("FATF") member jurisdiction that has implemented licensing or registration requirements pursuant to its FATF guidance obligations, or (ii) certain regulated financial services firms (_e.g._, banks, broker-dealers) registered or licensed in a FATF member jurisdiction and permitted to perform VASP activities, and regulated with respect to those activities, under such license or registration.

 

Consistent with the FATF definition, Libra Networks [generally] understands a **VASP** to be a person conducting any of the following business activities or operations for or on behalf of another person:

* exchange between Libra Coins and fiat currencies;
* exchange between Libra Coins and one or more other forms of virtual assets (including other single currency stablecoins);
* transfer of Libra Coins;
* safekeeping or administration of Libra Coins or of cryptographic private keys enabling control over Libra Coins; and
* participation in and provision of financial services related to the offer or sale of Libra Coins.


## What is FATF? How Do I Know if My Business is in a FATF Member Jurisdiction and Whether that Jurisdiction Has Implemented Relevant VASP Requirements?

 

The FATF is an international standard-setting body for anti-money laundering and combatting the financing of terrorism. The FATF currently comprises the following 37 member jurisdictions: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States.

 

In June 2019, the FATF issued guidance and revised standards regarding virtual assets and VASPs.  The FATF indicated that it would monitor the implementation of the new requirements by countries and service providers and would conduct a progress review in June 2020.  On July 7, 2020, the FATF issued its 12-Month Review of the Revised FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers in which, among other things, it found that certain jurisdictions reported that they have implemented the revised FATF, others had not yet done so in their national law, and a small number of jurisdictions has prohibited the operation of VASPs. Based on jurisdiction self-reporting, the FATF identified that 24 member jurisdictions have implemented the FATF revised recommendations and 13 member jurisdictions have not. The FATF, however, has not publicly identified which specific member jurisdictions fall into each category.

 

Libra Networks is carrying out its own review of FATF member jurisdiction national laws regarding VASPs and the extent of implementation of licensing or registration regimes regulating such businesses. If you are a VASP in a FATF member jurisdiction, you should contact Libra Networks to determine whether your jurisdiction's regulatory framework would allow you to qualify as a Regulated VASP.

 


## What Types of Information Will be Requested During the Vetting Process?

 

Each applicant seeking consideration as a Regulated VASP will be required to complete an initial due diligence questionnaire ("IDDQ") to allow the Libra Networks compliance team to confirm that the applicant meets the baseline definition of Regulated VASP and to conduct a preliminary risk assessment of the applicant VASP.

 

The IDDQ will require that applicants for Regulated VASP treatment provide certain information about your business, including with respect to the following:

- **Corporate:** The applicant VASP's physical location, country of incorporation, entity identifying number(s), and other corporate information;
- **Ownership and Control:** The legal entity organizational structure, beneficial ownership, and control structure of the applicant VASP;
- **Regulatory:** The licensing, registration or other regulatory frameworks to which the applicant VASP is subject, including information about the jurisdictions in which the applicant VASP holds licenses and the nature and duration of the licenses it holds;
- **Compliance History:** The applicant VASP's compliance history, including whether the applicant has been subject to investigation or criminal or civil proceedings related to money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions, or any other financial crime.
- **Products and Services:** The types of products and services offered by the applicant VASP, including whether the applicant provides fiat-related financial services, fiat-to-virtual asset conversion, wallet services, virtual asset brokerage services, tokenization services, or certain types of loans.
- **Customers:** The jurisdictions in which the applicant VASP's customers are located and the nature of its customers' businesses, as well as the nature of regulatory due diligence conducted on customers.
 
In addition to the completed IDDQ, each applicant will be required to provide the following information to substantiate its responses:

- Representations to Libra Networks that it has obtained and maintains all relevant and necessary licenses and registrations;
- Documentation to verify the existence of those licenses or registrations, as necessary;
- A copy of the shareholder list or register, certificate of incorporation or similar document; and
- A copy of government issued identification documents that display the date of birth, address, and identification number of certain natural persons with ownership interests in or control responsibility over the VASP above certain thresholds in this document, as well as authorized signatories.
 

Libra Networks will review all of the information provided in response to the IDDQ as well as other publicly available information and will assess whether an applicant is eligible for consideration as a Regulated VASP. 
 

For those applicants determined to be eligible, Libra Networks will request additional due diligence of the applicant, including regarding the applicant VASP's approach to financial crime compliance. This second phase of due diligence will vary by applicant and will be based in part on the information provided in response to the IDDQ.

## Will Every VASP on the Libra Network Go Through a Vetting Process?

Yes. As noted above, at launch only Regulated VASPs will be permitted to operate on LPN.  Every Regulated VASP will be subject to a risk-based due diligence process by Libra Networks (or an authorized third-party service provider) prior to being authorized to provide services on LPN.

Every Regulated VASP that operates on LPN, however, is required to maintain its own compliance program and to comply with its own independent regulatory obligations. While Regulated VASPs will be vetted by Libra Networks in accordance with Libra Networks' risk-based due diligence framework, Libra Networks is not conducting this review for or on behalf of any other party, including any Regulated VASP.  Every Regulated VASP must determine for itself whether it will engage or transact with any other Regulated VASP and should take appropriate steps, including measures required of it under applicable law and its own compliance program, to conduct due diligence and assess the regulatory, counterparty and other risks that another Regulated VASP may pose.
